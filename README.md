## My process

-Observe the desired image to get clear pictorial picture overview

-Check the boxes needed:

1. Boxes for the img, bold-text and the latter text

2. Should include main-container as a semantic.

3. The rest of the content include; img and subtext  should have individual element


## My steps

1. create an element container to contain all the element. i.e <section>

2. Create the following element to contain ; <img>,<div>-content,<article>-context.

3. Crate a footer to contain the "Challenge-proverder" and the name of the "challenge solver".

## Note!! Semantics Used:

-<main> for the whole challege
-<figure>;for image
-<article>; for text
-<footer>;for challenge providers and solver


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned


section {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
align-items: center;
    border-radius: 1rem;
background-color: white;
max-width: 225px;
height: 370px;
text-align: center;
}



### Continued development

-Flexbox; needs more exercises
